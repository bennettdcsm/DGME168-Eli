        <h3>More About Me</h3>
<p>I love houseplants. There are so many unique and incredible-looking plants that create a touch of natural beauty in any space you put them in. There’s also an interesting challenge that comes with houseplants in that, you have to consider each plant’s unique characteristics and needs and create an environment where the plant can thrive based on those needs. The journey of watching your plants grow bigger and bigger is incredibly satisfying. And I recommend it to everyone.</p>

        <p>I enjoy distance running because it’s a great way to decompress and mull over the thoughts in your head. I try to challenge myself by running new routes and beating personal records. There’s also no better feeling than when that hype song plays at the perfect moment activating that runner's high.</p>

        <p>Deckbuilding in Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a physical trading card game where players build decks before fighting each other with those decks. With over twenty-seven thousand unique cards there are so many ways to craft your deck and to create synergies between your cards. Add on top of that pitting your deck against another player and you have an infinitely replayable and fantastically deep game.</p>

        <p>Watching movies is a ritual for me. I like to be maximally focused on the movie I’m watching with as few distractions as possible. My favorite directors include Robbert Eggars, Yorgos Lanthimos, and Alex Garland.</p>

        <p>Video games are both a great medium to have unique interactive experiences and a great way to connect with friends even if you’re not physically together. I often play games with friends and family. Video games often create so much passion in people whether you’re working together to achieve a goal or competing against each other, video games will often have people laughing or yelling at each other.</p>
