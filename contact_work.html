        <h4>Que SeRaw Seraw</h4>
        <p>Que SeRaw Seraw is a raw and vegan takeout restaurant located in Burlingame. It hosts a wide variety of food with a revolving menu of delicious and healthy meals. I’ve worked there for 4 years and I am currently working there now. Because this restaurant is a small local place I’m often left with a wide variety of tasks. On an average day, you can find me serving customers, preparing ingredients, cooking dishes, putting together orders, tracking inventory, and cleaning. There’s never a dull moment, and there’s always work to be done. Because of this, I've learned to work efficiently and stay focused on my goals.</p>
        
        <h4>Sequoia Foods</h4>
        <p>Sequoia Foods is a small grocery store in Burlingame. I worked here for about ten weeks and gained a lot of valuable experience. Similarly to Que Seraw, this was a smaller shop where I was doing a little bit of everything, such as: Ringing up customers, Tracking inventory, checking expiration dates, scooping ice cream, cleaning, and facing. Although definitely less hectic than Que Seraw, there’s still always work to be done, and because I worked alone, I had to set tasks for myself to complete while paying attention to our customers and products.</p>
        
        <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
        <p>I have a year of graphic design experience creating many designs from posters to CD covers. My designs often incorporate striking colors and imagery. My experience comes from the College of San Mateo, completing many courses such as intermediate graphic design, typography, and history of graphic design.</p>
